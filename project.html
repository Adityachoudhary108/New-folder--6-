        The polar bear (Ursus maritimus) is a large bear native to the Arctic
        and nearby areas. It is closely related to the brown bear, and the two
        species can interbreed. The polar bear is the largest extant species of
        bear and land carnivore,<b
          ><i>
            with adult males weighing 300–800 kg (660–1,760 lb). The species is
            sexually dimorphic, as adult females are much smaller</i
          ></b
        >. The polar bear is white- or yellowish-furred with black skin and a
        thick layer of fat. It is more slender than the brown bear, with a
        narrower skull, longer neck and lower shoulder hump. Its teeth are
        sharper and more adapted to cutting meat. The paws are large and allow
        the bear to walk on ice and paddle in the water. Polar bears are both
        terrestrial and pagophilic (ice-living) and are considered marine
        mammals because of their dependence on marine ecosystems. They prefer
        the annual sea ice but live on land when the ice melts in the summer.
        They are mostly carnivorous and specialized for preying on seals,
        particularly ringed seals. Such prey is typically taken by ambush; the
        bear may stalk its prey on the ice or in the water, but also will stay
        at a breathing hole or ice edge to wait for prey to swim by. The bear
        primarily feeds on the seal's energy-rich blubber.
